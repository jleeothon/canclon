# canclon

Flexible template name resolution for Django class-based views.

## Introduction

*canclÃ³n* is a local name for the horned screamer, *Anhima cornuta*. This is a group of [class-based views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/class-based-views/) for [Django](http://djangoproject.com/). The simple flexibility of this group of classes is comparable to that of horned screamer's [horn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1esf6WNdvso).

Django's default method for template name resolution has a couple of not-so niceties, such as default template suffixes appended with an underscore (yay for dashes).

Warning:

> Including this functionality in your project makes template name resolution "DRYier" and more flexible but a bit slower.
